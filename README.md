### A fullstack application using node.js and mongoDB, deployed via Heroku.

The goal of this application was to create a web app that interacts with a live database, which can be manipulated by the user to create, edit, or delete entries in the database. The application has a diner theme but the user is free to add whatever they wish to it.
